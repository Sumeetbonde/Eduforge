                <p>
                    With the rise of cyber threats, ML is becoming an essential tool in cybersecurity. ML-powered security systems detect anomalies, identify potential breaches, and automate threat response in real time. Fraud detection models protect financial transactions from malicious activities, and AI-driven authentication systems enhance digital security. However, as cybercriminals increasingly exploit AI, the ongoing development of robust ML-driven security measures is crucial to staying ahead of evolving threats.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    While Machine Learning offers groundbreaking possibilities, ethical concerns must be carefully managed. Issues such as biased algorithms, data privacy violations, and ethical dilemmas in AI decision-making require strong governance and transparency. Fair and accountable ML systems must be developed to ensure that technology serves humanity equitably. Policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders must collaborate to establish guidelines that promote responsible ML use.
